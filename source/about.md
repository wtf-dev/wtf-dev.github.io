Coding is like this mystical language that people talk about using fancy jargon and obfuscation. 

We wanted to change that.

WTF Development provides an overview of coding from the ground up, for anyone to understand.

It's not the most thorough and comprehensive site out there. We are, ourselves, just product guys with business backgrounds coming to learn coding. We wanted to give a head-start and some basic info to get you started. The stuff that most people overlook.
