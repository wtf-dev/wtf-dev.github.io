As I'm writing this, I have at least 20 tabs open. This is because I decided to do things my way rather than the easy way.

When you start developing, you should always do things the easy way.

This site is built using 'Jekyll'; it doesn't matter exactly what that is. In fact you shouldn't care what it is, in the same way as a novice 'eater' you don't care what's in the dish as long as it tastes good.

But Jekyll is natively built to work on Linux. In a sense, this is like trying to plug in a hair dryer from the US in Europe. It just won't work, because the basic specs are different. 

Except in software development it's a LOT more complicated. 

Right now, I have 20 tabs open looking up lots of obscure errors, having to do specifically with the relatively asinine way I wanted to build this site - across a Linux and Windows machine. 

As a result, I've had to debug at least 10 errors, and trace them down rabbit holes to figure out who has exactly the same configuration as me, trying to understand exactly what's going on, and looking through log files.

Sound like fun? I didn't think so.

But the point is that building anything, even the simplest thing, will require patience. You will find bugs in the most infuriating places, even as you follow step by step instructions.

More so than anything, the world of software, especially open source software, is like a gigantic improvisational symphony where anyone can play, regardless of skill level. At first, it's a complete disaster. No one can agree on style, volume, which instruments, etc. Instead of playing, people argue, or just try to play the loudest. Eventually individuals or small groups create nice little melodies, which others add on to. But people leave, and some people decide they want to change the melodies. 

Harmonies and melodies that were great together no longer feel correct. 

This poorly disguised analogy is a great one for open source software. As people make 'improvements' to their software packages, things can break across different platforms and different configurations. For this reason, I should state again, patience is required.

As you can see, I've finally built this site, installed all the right libraries and can develop how I want to. It wasn't the easiest thing to do, but there is some satisfaction in its completion.
