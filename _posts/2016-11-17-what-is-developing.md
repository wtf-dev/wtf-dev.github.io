Let's just jump right in. What is Developing, anyway? 

Developing has: 
- languages
- tools
- 'infrastructure'

In many ways, it's similar to building a house. If you want to build a house from scratch, you're going to need to know a LOT of stuff. About physics, architecture, materials, construction, electrical, plumbing, etc. 

Almost no one builds a large house from scratch, or if they do, they build tents, huts, yurts, etc with simple materials.

Developing is in many ways a similar idea: building something complex requires a large amount of knowledge. You likely can't acquire all of it in any short period of time. 

Let's first focus on the 'basics' underlying programming or 'computer science' itself. In short, 'Developing' involves telling a very specific machine, a computer, what to do. 

Computers don't understand English (yet). So for now, we have to speak to them in special languages, called 'programming langagues.'

These programming languages come in all shapes and sizes, but ultimately all of them turn your thoughts into 1s and 0s. This fact itself is INCREDIBLE. There has been a ton of intellectually difficult work done by millions of men and women to make this possible. Everything from the semiconductor to memory to hard disks to assembly languages to operating systems to programming languages - all of these are truly modern marvels. 

We'll get into all of these at some point, but I'll assume for now you have a smartphone or a computer (otherwise how are you on this site?). To get this text to display to you on your device, there's a massive cascade different programs and protocols. Most of them share the following characteristics:

These are basic elements of programming and programming languages:

====

Input

Algorithm

Output

====

Inputs:

Variable
Integer
Float
Double
Char
Boolean
String

Operators (or things you can do to inputs):
Operators often confuse people because it sounds technical. As an abstraction, an operator is just something you can do to data. That's it. Simple math is an operation.' 2 + 2 is 4. What did you 'do' to 2 to get four? You added it right? Adding is an operation, signified by the symbol +

Here's a list of operators:
+ 
-
/ 
*
m
= or assignment
== or is equal

Conditions

Loops

Threads

Events

Functions
(Programs within programs)
Functions take 'arguments', which are inputs, usually in parentheses or some other marking text. You often will have to declare the input type as well as the input value, which can be a variable. 

ie

int square(int x)
{
	return (x * x);
}

'square' is a function that takes the integer variable 'x' as its input, and returns x multiplied by x (or x squared) as its output.

Compile

Compiling: switching between 'higher level language'
1) Preprocessing

Preprocessing pulls in other libraries and expands text as per defintions.

2) Compilation

Compiling code changes 'high level' code like C into assembly code

3) Assembly

Assembly changes the assembly code into machine language, which is readable by the computer

4) Linking

Linking links files together if you need to run them together

Libraries
Code that other people have written already. Because of 'abstraction' you don't need to know how the code actually works, just what it does.

In reality, all of your daily life uses this 'abstraction' mentality. You don't need to know how your TV works to watch TV, or how the fridge works to keep your food cold. You do, however, have to know that you input numbers to get to different channels and that you put food in the fridge, not tools. 

In a similar way, libraries require that you know how to use them, even if you don't know how they work exactly.
