WTF Dev is probably not unique. It's probably not the best out there, I'll admit.

What it does provide, however, is a 'bottoms up' view of coding at a very practical level. Questions like: how can I build a basic website? what is a server? what is the internet? 

As far as I know, I haven't seen a place with all of that information in one place. So I'm creating it. 

We'll occasionally show some code, evidenced with the following highlighting:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Don't be afraid of code. In some sense it's just like English, but in other ways it's like magical incantations that you speak to a computer to get it to do stuff. Separate the two for now. Focus on the words and predicting what it will do. We'll get to teaching you the magic later.

For now, enjoy the site!
